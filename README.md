# generator-lean-website
> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator

## Getting Started

#### A website generator, with:
* [gulp](http://www.gulpjs.com) for building;
* CSS or [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), for styling;
* JavaSript or [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/), for scripting;
* HTML or [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), for templating;

#### The generator will also ask if you want to include
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), which doesn't need introduction;
and
* [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), for even more icons;

### Setup
To install generator-lean-website from npm, run:

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-lean-website
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
$ yo lean-website
```

This was made for personal use, but I hope this generator can be usefull for someone.
If you want to add something or fix something, please fell confortable to make a PR or create an issue!
